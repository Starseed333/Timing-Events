# **Timing Events**

### **Description**

JavaScript can be executed in time-intervals. These are several projects that demonstrate the capabilities of using the two key methods that we are able to use with Javascript. How do you stop the execution of these events you may ask? Using the clearTimeout(timeoutVariable) method.

* setTimeout(function, milliseconds)
  Executes a function, after waiting a specified number of milliseconds.


* setInterval(function, milliseconds)
 Same as setTimeout(), but repeats the execution of the function continuously.
